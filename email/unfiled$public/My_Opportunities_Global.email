Hi Everyone,

There's a new view in Salesforce.  It's called My Opportunities - Global.  To access it, click on the Opportunities tab > in View window select > My Opportunities - Global.  The view will show you all of the Global Opportunities that you own.  Please complete the fields where the data is missing.

If you need any help or have any questions, please contact your Salesforce Administrator.

Thanks,

Madeline Krazit
Salesforce Administrator
