Hi Everyone,

I've noticed some inconsistencies in the naming convention used for the "Subject Line" on activities logged in Salesforce. I've attached a Cheat Sheet that will help you follow the format when creating a subject line on activity records (i.e. new task, new event, log a call, etc.).

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
