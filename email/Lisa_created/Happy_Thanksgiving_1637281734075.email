<span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Dear&nbsp;{{{Recipient.FirstName}}},<br />
<br />
I hope that you are doing well, and planning on having a wonderful and relaxing Thanksgiving holiday next week. I am starting to look for those old pie crust recipes and hope to have at least one trial run at the old favorites before showtime on Thursday! lol How about you?<br />
<br />
I just wanted to let you know that I appreciate the opportunity to chat with you and discuss various aspects of business travel and how they impact organizations like yours. These are extremely unusual times, but I think everyone that I know of is doing their very best! That can only mean we are all that much better in many ways.<br />
<br />
I&nbsp;am looking forward to future discussions and better things to come for us all as we wind down 2021.<br />
<br />
Happy Thanksgiving!<br />
<br />
Warm regards,<br />
Lisa<br />
